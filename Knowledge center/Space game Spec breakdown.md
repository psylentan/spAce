Executive Summary / High-Level Concept
Elevator Pitch
A retro-stylized space adventure blending shoot-em-up action with exploration and deck-building strategy. The game uses multiple decks of cards for different encounter types, alongside inventory management and crew recruitment/upgrades. Players engage in faction-driven conflicts, intense space battles, high-stakes negotiations, and planetary explorations. Throughout the journey, they navigate dynamic relationships that evolve based on the decks they build and the decisions they make.
Target Audience and Platforms
Platforms: Separate versions for PC and Mobile, with optimized controls for each.
Business Model: Freemium (free to play) with an in-game store. Monetization focuses on cosmetic upgrades, expansion content, and optional battle/season passes, avoiding any pay-to-win mechanics.
Target Audience: Fans of roguelike deck-builders (e.g., Griftlands, Night of Full Moon) and space-themed exploration games. Players who enjoy strategic card gameplay and open-ended sci-fi adventures will be the core audience.
Core Gameplay and Mechanics
Gameplay Loop
Choose a Character – Begin each run by selecting a character, each with a unique background, stats, and deck-building synergies that encourage different playstyles.
Explore Space – Travel through a mix of procedurally generated and hand-crafted encounters: visit planets, space stations, strange anomalies, engage in faction conflicts, etc.
Deck-Based Encounters – Build and modify specialized decks for different encounter types: Space Battles, Negotiations, Crew Combat, and Exploration challenges. Each encounter draws cards from its relevant deck, so preparation is key.
Gather & Upgrade – Collect resources and loot from encounters. Recruit new crew members, upgrade their skills, and acquire ship modifications or new cards to strengthen your decks.
Manage Factions – Every action and card choice can affect your reputation with various factions. High reputation might grant favors or trading perks, while low reputation can trigger ambushes or increased prices.
Rivals & Relationships – Encounter rival characters and NPCs who remember past interactions. They might become allies, offer assistance, betray you later, or turn into nemeses based on your choices.
Run Conclusion – Continue adventuring until the run ends (often in defeat, as is roguelike tradition). Each run contributes to meta-progression: you unlock new characters, cards, and permanent upgrades that carry into future runs.
Controls
PC (Keyboard & Mouse): Pilot your ship with WASD keys. Use the mouse to select and play cards during encounters, and navigate menus (hotkeys for quick access to decks, inventory, etc. will be provided for efficiency).
Mobile (Touch): Virtual joystick for ship movement on touchscreen. Tap cards to select and play them; tap/drag for targeting in battles or navigating the UI. The interface will be simplified and responsive for smaller screens.
Core Mechanics
Deck-Building & Faction System


In this game, players manage multiple decks for different encounter types (combat, negotiation, etc.), a concept inspired by other deck-builders that use separate decks for battle and diplomacy​
PCGAMER.COM
. Crucially, each deck’s composition also influences your standing with in-game factions. Including a faction’s cards in your deck can improve your reputation with that group (while perhaps straining relations with rival factions). The screenshot above is from Griftlands, showing a card-based negotiation encounter where characters duel using arguments instead of weapons – an example of how our negotiation deck might function in gameplay. This multi-deck system ensures that whether you’re fighting or talking your way out of a situation, you have a specialized set of cards and that your choices have ripple effects on faction relationships.
Faction Reputation: Your reputation with each faction is calculated dynamically based on your deck composition and in-game actions. For example:
The percentage of cards in a deck that are aligned with a faction (using that faction’s technology or culture) will sway how that faction and its allies/enemies view you.
Direct interactions during events (helping a faction, attacking them, betraying agreements) cause immediate reputation shifts.
Completing faction-specific objectives (quests given by a faction) grants reputation boosts with that group (and possibly drops with their adversaries).
Reputation Effects: Faction reputation isn’t just a number—it has tangible impacts on the game:
Trade & Economy: High rep can yield better prices from that faction’s traders, access to unique cards or items, and perhaps special services. Low rep might bar you from certain shops or inflate prices.
Travel & Safety: In regions of space controlled by a faction, being on good terms means you won’t be attacked on sight and might even receive aid. If you’re hated, expect blockades, ambushes, or denial of entry.
Story & Encounters: Reputation influences special encounters. A beloved status with a faction might trigger story events where they ask for your help in a major mission. Being infamous could result in bounty hunters (from that faction or their allies) coming after you, or characters refusing to deal with you.
Inventory System
Limited Slots: The game uses a slot-based inventory, meaning your ship can only carry a finite number of items. This requires strategic management of what you pick up and keep. Expanding inventory space might be possible via upgrades or certain ship types.
Item Types: Items include ship upgrades (e.g., better shields, engines), crew equipment (weapons or tools that enhance crew performance), consumables (like repair kits, fuel, medpacks), and special artifacts from events.
Resource Management: Key resources (fuel, credits, supplies) also take up space or have limits, forcing players to make tough decisions—do you haul valuable cargo for trade, or stock more fuel for a longer journey?
Crew Members
Recruitment: Over the course of a run, you can encounter potential crew members. Each comes with unique abilities and possibly a personal quest or story. You’ll have to decide if their benefits outweigh the extra mouth to feed (or the risk of a traitor).
Upgrades & Roles: Crew members gain experience or can be upgraded (through training or events). They might have classes or roles (pilot, engineer, soldier, diplomat, etc.) that give bonuses in corresponding encounters. For example, a skilled engineer on board might grant extra shield repair in space combat, while a charismatic diplomat could boost your negotiation deck.
Traits: Some crew have special traits that affect gameplay positively or negatively. For instance, a crew member with the "Curse of the Drifter" might reduce ship speed or attract strange encounters, adding an element of risk. Others might have traits like “Loyal” (won’t abandon you even if morale is low) or “Greedy” (might steal an item if unpaid).
Crew Combat: In certain encounters (like boarding actions or away missions on planets), you’ll rely on your crew in a turn-based card fight. Your Crew Combat deck is influenced by which crew members you have and their equipment. Losing crew in these fights can be permanent (they can die or be injured), which adds weight to those conflicts.
Roguelike Progression
Run-Based Play: The game is structured as runs (similar to Slay the Spire or FTL). When you fail or finish a run, you start a new journey from the beginning. However, each run yields rewards for the meta-game.
Meta-Progession: Between runs, players unlock permanent upgrades and content:
New Characters: Unlock additional starting characters with different starting decks or abilities, increasing variety.
New Cards: Discover new cards that will be added to the pool for future runs (they might then appear as loot or shop options next time).
Ship Modules: Unlock new ship types or modules that you can start with or find, such as a medical bay (helps crew healing between fights) or cloaking device (adds a special card to your space combat deck).
Abilities: Gain account-level perks (small bonuses) like +5% starting credits, or the ability to retain one card between runs.
Difficulty & Scaling: As you progress in meta-unlocks, the game can introduce higher difficulty levels or new challenges (e.g., harder enemy variants, new factions) to keep the experience fresh. Players can also unlock alternative game modes (daily challenges, hardcore permadeath with no meta progression, etc.).
Story & Narrative
Story Overview
The backdrop is a galaxy on the brink of chaos. A cosmic anomaly has appeared – a tear in space-time that defies understanding. All major factions either scramble to harness its power or prevent a catastrophe. The player character is a rogue agent (a free adventurer with no initial faction allegiance) who finds themselves entwined in this crisis. As you explore and survive, you’ll gradually uncover the mystery behind the anomaly and ultimately have a chance to influence its outcome (for better or worse). The narrative is branching and dynamic. No two runs tell the exact same story, but there is an overarching plot about the anomaly. Through multiple runs, the player reveals different facets of the storyline, piecing together a grand narrative puzzle. Themes include shifting alliances, betrayal, sacrifice, and the question of whether to rewrite fate or preserve the status quo.
Characters & NPCs
Player Characters: Each playable character (unlocked through progression) has their own backstory and motivations. For example, one might be an ex-faction pilot seeking redemption, another a smuggler out for profit. These backgrounds grant unique dialogue options and may alter how certain story events play out.
Faction Leaders: Key NPCs lead each major faction (corporate CEO, alien warlord, rebel queen, etc.). They appear in story events, and your relationship with their faction will determine if they treat you as a trusted confidant or a threat. You might negotiate peace between two leaders in one run, only to be hunted by those same leaders in the next run if choices differ.
Rivals and Allies: Throughout your travels, you’ll meet recurring characters. For instance, a mercenary captain could become a valuable ally in one playthrough (if you helped him earlier) or a vengeful foe in another (if you crossed him). These characters remember past interactions within the same run and sometimes across runs via the narrative (in a meta-sense, some characters might break the fourth wall of roguelike resets, adding intrigue).
Dialogue & Choices: Conversations often present multiple choices. Your decisions (and negotiation deck outcomes) can lead to branching paths — you might talk your way out of a fight entirely, convince someone to join you, or provoke an unnecessary battle. The tone you take (aggressive, diplomatic, cunning) will shape your character’s reputation and how others respond.
The story is delivered through in-game events, dialogues, and some comic-style cutscenes for major plot points. It maintains a light space opera tone with moments of humor and drama, akin to shows like Farscape or the adventurous spirit of Doctor Who, but always influenced by player agency.
World Building & Exploration
Environments & Encounters
Galactic Map: Each run generates a star map with multiple regions (sectors). Regions might be controlled by different factions or contain unique phenomena. For example, one sector could be under strict military rule of the Dominion, while another is lawless pirate space, and a third contains the unpredictable anomaly zones.
Locations: Exploration is both procedural and hand-crafted. You can encounter:
Planets: Some habitable with cities or colonies where you can land, trade, and pick up quests; others barren or wild where exploration yields resources or ancient secrets.
Space Stations: Hubs of activity where you might gamble, recruit crew at a cantina, or get ambushed if you have enemies.
Anomalies: Strange rifts or derelicts with mini-events (could be combat challenges, puzzles, or story vignettes) — high risk, high reward areas.
Faction Strongholds: Approaching a major faction’s base could trigger story missions or intense battles, depending on your reputation.
Mystical Rifts: Occasionally, you encounter weird otherworldly locations influenced by the space-time tear (surreal mini-levels with unique rules, somewhat inspired by the chaos of Noita in theme).
Dynamic Faction Control: Factions dynamically control territories each run. For instance, in one playthrough the Rebels might have taken over a sector that was neutral before, changing the encounters there (more checkpoints, different quests). This territorial war can shift even during a run; if you help a faction win a big battle, they might seize control of a system, altering future encounters in that area.
Environmental Hazards: Space is dangerous beyond just enemies:
Space Phenomena: Nebulas that disable your sensors (as in FTL, you’re effectively flying blind), asteroid fields that can damage your ship during travel, black holes or gravitational anomalies that might pull you into a random location.
Planetary Hazards: If exploring a planet, you might face toxic atmospheres (needing a specific crew skill or item to survive), ancient traps in ruins, or wildlife attacks.
Stellar Events: Supernovas or solar flares in a system could impose time limits on how long you can stay (e.g., a timer before you take damage), pushing the player to make quick decisions.
Exploration Gameplay: Movement in space is semi-freeform within each region (you can fly around within a sector to discover points of interest, similar to an open world). However, jumping between sectors/regions uses a node-based system (star map nodes connected by hyperspace lanes). On planets or stations, exploration might switch to a choose-your-own-adventure style text interface or a top-down view for short segments, depending on scope.
The world is rich with lore that players can uncover in item descriptions, dialogue, and logs. Each faction has a history, and scattered journals or relics tell stories of the universe, providing context for the larger narrative and the anomaly at the center of it all.
Aesthetics & UI


The game adopts a retro sci-fi aesthetic, drawing inspiration from classic space shooters and 80s/90s sci-fi art. Spaceships, characters, and environments are depicted with stylized low-poly 3D models, giving a modern indie feel while evoking nostalgia. The image above is a concept design reflecting this style, showing a simple spaceship and astronauts in a vintage color palette. The art direction aims to capture the futurism of classic arcade space games and the charm of old science fiction shows, creating a world that feels both familiar and fresh.
Visual Style
Art Style: Inspired by titles like Gradius (for its arcade space combat vibe) and TV series like Farscape and Doctor Who (for their imaginative sci-fi worlds and retro-futuristic elements). Expect vibrant cosmic backdrops, quirky alien designs, and a touch of whimsy in visuals.
Graphics: Low-poly 3D models with a distinct retro sci-fi color palette. This means simpler geometric shapes for ships and characters (for a slight old-school look) combined with bold colors and neon highlights reminiscent of 80s synthwave art. Despite the low-poly approach, the design will ensure clarity in gameplay (distinct silhouettes for ships, easily readable animations for attacks, etc.).
Card UI: The card and interface design takes cues from modern deck-builders like Griftlands and Night of Full Moon. Cards will have clear illustrations and iconography. During encounters, the UI will show player and enemy statuses in an easy-to-read layout (for example, in negotiations, speech bubbles or argument icons hover around characters, whereas in ship combat, you'll see shields/hull bars for each vessel). Overall, the UI will be clean and intuitive, with minimal clutter, using retro-style fonts and holographic effects for flavor.
UI/UX Considerations
Deck Management Screen: A dedicated interface for editing your decks between encounters. It will use drag-and-drop card management on PC, and tap-and-drag on mobile. Decks are separated into tabs by type (Combat, Negotiation, etc.) with faction affiliation icons highlighting which cards affect which reputations.
Ship Upgrade UI: A modular layout showing your ship’s systems and slots. For example, players see a top-down schematic of the ship with slots for weapons, engines, shields, etc., which they can click to install or upgrade parts. Crew stations might be displayed here too (who is manning which station).
Faction Reputation Display: The HUD includes an easy-to-read indicator of your standing with key factions. This could be represented by emblems that change color or fill (green/ally, red/hostile, neutral) and tooltips to explain current effects. For instance, hovering over the faction icon shows “Allied – trade discount 10%” or “Hostile – will attack on sight”.
Feedback & Responsiveness: Retro sound effects (beeps, radio static) accompany button presses and menu transitions to reinforce the theme. The UX is designed to be responsive: when a card is played, expect snappy animations and clear feedback (damage numbers, status effect icons) so the player can easily follow the outcome of their actions.
Accessibility: The game will include options for colorblind-friendly card suits/faction colors, scalable text for dialogues and card text (important on mobile), and maybe a simplified mode where some of the complex mechanics (like faction reputation) are toned down for casual play.
Audio & Music
Soundtrack: A dynamic synthwave-inspired soundtrack sets the mood. During exploration, the music is ambient and mysterious, emphasizing the vastness of space. In combat or high-tension encounters, it shifts to upbeat retro electronic tracks to pump the player up. The music will change based on location and situation — e.g., entering a faction's territory might layer in that faction’s leitmotif, or reaching the final anomaly could introduce eerie, otherworldly tones. (We plan to leverage SUNO.ai for assisting in composing adaptive music that can transition smoothly between these states.)
Sound Design: Retro-futuristic sound effects abound. Expect classic 8-bit and 16-bit arcade sounds for UI interactions and minor effects (to nail the retro vibe), mixed with modern touches. For example, laser blasts and engine hums have a nostalgic tone but are layered to feel punchy. Alien languages or robot voices use scrambled synth effects (think Bucky O’Hare or classic arcade shooters for inspiration). Each faction might have distinct audio cues — e.g., the high-tech faction’s ships have a sharp electronic engine sound, while an alien faction uses organic, growling engine noises. Overall, the audio design supports the gameplay by providing clear cues (a specific jingle when you gain a reputation level, an alarming klaxon when your hull is critical, etc.) while enriching the sci-fi atmosphere.
Technical Specifications
Tools & Stack
Game Engine: Phaser 3 (v3.70.0) – Chosen for its lightweight performance and cross-platform capabilities, especially suited for a 2D/2.5D game that needs to run on both PC and mobile. Phaser will drive the core gameplay, rendering, and input handling.
Backend / Framework: Next.js – Utilized for any online components, such as procedural world generation seeding, player progression backups on cloud, and possibly managing user accounts or leaderboards. Next.js could also host a simple web portal for the game (if needed for cross-save between PC and mobile).
Platforms: The PC version will be packaged (likely with Electron or a native wrapper) to integrate with the web-based core from Phaser. The mobile version will be built as a native app (using Phaser’s Cordova/Cocoon integration or similar) for iOS/Android distribution.
Performance: Target 60 FPS on both PC and mid-range mobile devices. Graphics are intentionally not too heavy (low-poly models, optimized sprites) and Phaser is excellent for this level of graphical complexity. We’ll incorporate efficient memory usage practices, given potentially large number of cards and assets.
AI-Assisted Asset Generation
SUNO.ai (Music): Employed to help generate adaptive music tracks. The AI can create variations of a base theme to match different moods (combat, calm, etc.), which we can then fine-tune. This accelerates the soundtrack iteration process while maintaining a coherent musical identity.
OpenAI (Content): Used for procedural text generation — for instance, to help draft the hundreds of possible mini-encounters, NPC dialogues, or quest descriptions. The AI will be guided by templates to ensure consistency in tone. It might also assist in balancing by simulating player choices in events.
Stability AI (Art): Leveraged for concept art and possibly to create background images or textures. For example, generating unique planet backdrops or exotic alien creature designs which artists can then touch up. This helps a solo developer produce a wider variety of art assets without starting each from scratch.
(The use of AI tools will augment development, but all outputs will be reviewed and integrated carefully to maintain quality and thematic consistency.)
Monetization & Business Model
Fair Free-to-Play: The game will be free to download and play through all core content. Monetization is designed to avoid pay-to-win entirely, focusing instead on optional content and cosmetics.
Cosmetic Upgrades: Players can purchase cosmetics such as ship skins, alternate character outfits, or card backs with unique visuals. These do not affect gameplay stats, only personalization.
Expansions/DLCs: Periodically, new content packs might be released (new faction, new story chapter, etc.) which can be purchased as one-time DLC or earned through gameplay for dedicated players. These expansions integrate with the game’s lore and provide new challenges without giving any player an unfair advantage.
Battle/Season Passes: A possible seasonal system where players can complete challenges to unlock exclusive cosmetic rewards and lore tidbits. For example, a “Galactic War Season” might have players earn points to unlock a special crew member skin or a unique card variant. The pass would be paid, but all gameplay content (like the actual cards or characters) would also be unlockable via free play — the pass mainly speeds up cosmetic rewards and provides a structured set of goals.
In-Game Store: Central hub for purchases; uses an in-game currency that can be bought or earned slowly. Prices will be transparent. The store might also rotate interesting items like additional music tracks, or fun vanity things (e.g., different hologram effects for your card plays).
Ads: Likely no traditional ads in the PC version. For mobile, if needed, only opt-in ads (like “watch an ad to get a minor reward”) but this will be approached cautiously to avoid disrupting immersion.
The guiding principle is to build a loyal player base through enjoyable gameplay, then monetize in a way that fans feel is value-adding, not exploitative. Longevity and goodwill are prioritized over short-term gains.
Production Plan
Suggested Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Systems (Months 1–3)
Implement the core card game mechanics for space combat and negotiation encounters (basic playable prototypes of each).
Basic deck-building interface and card reward system after encounters.
Procedural generation framework for the world map and encounters (even if content is placeholder).
Basic ship navigation mechanics (moving in space, entering encounters).
Placeholder art and UI (using simple shapes for ships and basic cards).
(Goal: Have a rough playable loop of combat and negotiation by end of Phase 1.)
Phase 2: Content & Factions (Months 4–6)
Expand to all encounter types: add crew combat and exploration event gameplay.
Introduce faction system: implement reputation tracking and effects on encounters (e.g., faction-based hostile/ally behavior).
Populate the game world with a first pass of content: a few handcrafted story events, faction leader encounters, and random events.
Add 2–3 playable characters and a starter set of 100+ cards spread across the decks to test deck-building variety.
Start integrating some artwork (ship models, card art) to replace placeholders, focusing on one faction and one region as a vertical slice.
(Goal: By end of Phase 2, the game feels content-rich in one portion of the world, and the faction system makes an impact.)
Phase 3: Polish & Expansion (Months 7–9)
Sound and Music: Integrate the dynamic soundtrack and sound effects. Test how music transitions with gameplay states; adjust as needed.
UI/UX Polish: Refine the interfaces (deck builder, inventory, map) for clarity and ease of use. This includes adding tutorials or tooltips for complex systems like faction reputation.
Use AI tools to generate additional content: lots of side quests, flavor text, and artwork variations to avoid repetitiveness. Ensure each faction has distinct visual and narrative flavor.
Balance the cards and encounters: use playtesting (closed alpha) to see which strategies dominate and tweak values or mechanics for better balance.
Implement meta-progression systems (unlock flow, profile experience, etc.) and ensure new content unlocks at a satisfying pace.
Phase 4: Testing & Launch Prep (Months 10–12)
Beta Testing: Wider testing phase on both PC and mobile. Gather feedback on difficulty, controls (especially on mobile), and any technical issues across different devices.
Content Complete: All planned characters, cards, and story arcs are in place by early in this phase. Focus shifts to bug fixing and performance optimization.
Final Art Pass: Polish any remaining art assets, add animations (e.g., flashy effects for rare cards, animated backgrounds for the anomaly), and ensure consistency in art style.
Marketing and Hype: Release a trailer, start community engagement (Dev diaries showing off the deck-building or a faction reveal, etc.). Possibly run a small open beta or demo to build interest.
Launch: Prepare for release on app stores (Android/iOS) and PC (Steam or itch.io). Ensure compliance with store requirements, and set up backend servers (if needed for any online features).
Post-launch, the plan includes regular updates (bug fixes, balance patches) and developing the first major content update (new faction or story extension) as hinted by the season pass content.
Solo Developer Strategy
Developing such a game solo is ambitious, but leveraging modular design and AI assistance can make it feasible:
Modular Development: Build the game in pieces that can be developed and tested independently. For example, treat the space combat, negotiation, crew combat, etc., each as separate modules. This way, one can be working and playable while others are still in progress. It also helps isolate bugs and balance issues within each module.
Reuse and Adapt: Identify cross-over elements between systems. Perhaps the negotiation card mechanics share a lot with combat, just using different stats. By coding a flexible card system, the developer can reuse it for all encounter types with minor tweaks, rather than writing each from scratch.
Procedural Content with AI: Use AI generation to fill out content as mentioned. For instance, if the game needs 50 side quests, the developer can outline 10 and use AI to suggest variants for more. This saves time on creative writing and ensures variety. Similarly, AI can generate many card ideas, which the developer then curates and refines.
Time Management: Focus on core fun factor first (make sure the card battles are enjoyable and the loop is addictive). Less critical features (like extensive character customization, or super detailed graphics) can be trimmed or postponed if time runs short. As a solo dev, prioritizing is key.
Community Feedback: Engage a small community early (through an alpha on itch.io or a Discord server) to get feedback. This can act as a force multiplier for testing and ideas, essentially crowdsourcing some design insight and QA. It also builds a fanbase who are eager for the game, aiding motivation.
Outsourcing Wisely: While solo, the developer might consider contracting out small pieces if needed – e.g., commissioning a few music tracks or key art pieces that AI can’t easily produce to professional quality, or getting a consultant to review code for optimization.
By following the roadmap and remaining flexible, a solo developer can manage scope and create a robust game. Each phase’s completion will also serve as a milestone to show potential players or even investors, if needed, to gain support.
Supporting Materials
References & Inspirations: Griftlands, Night of Full Moon, FTL: Faster Than Light, Slay the Spire, Noita. These games influenced the design, whether through their deck-building mechanics, space exploration elements, or approach to roguelike progression.
**Appendices (to be developed)*: Detailed spreadsheets for card stats and balance calculations, a full tech-tree of ship upgrades, design documents for each faction’s theme and cards, and narrative charts illustrating possible story branches. These will be compiled as the project moves forward for internal tracking and playtesting purposes.
This concept document will be refined further based on feedback and testing results as development progresses. The vision is to create a unique blend of strategy and story that offers players high replayability and a personal space adventure every run. Let’s make this galaxy come alive!

Descrive and make a technical spec. Be as detailed as possible. Think and desceibe how data is stored and used, which data items and entitites exist and hie do they flow through the game.
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's break down a detailed technical specification and data architecture for your game. This will cover the core data entities, how they flow through the game systems, and how data is stored, accessed, and mutated across client (Phaser 3 game) and server (Next.js backend). The aim is to support features like deck-building, procedural world generation, inventory, crew, factions, and persistent meta-progression.

1. Architectural Overview
Client-Side (Phaser 3 + TypeScript)
Handles real-time gameplay, UI, and encounter logic.
Stores volatile data (run-based state, temporary variables, in-session card decks).
Uses local cache/storage for session saves, syncs progress to server.
Server-Side (Next.js + Express API)
Stores persistent player data (meta progression, unlocked cards, character stats).
Generates procedural seeds and fetches encounter content.
Uses a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL depending on relational needs).
Optionally uses AI service integration for event generation, story branching, and faction behavior.
2. Core Data Entities

3. Data Flow and Lifecycle
On New Run:
Player selects a character and starts a run.
Backend creates a RunState with:
Procedural seed
Initial galaxy nodes
Default decks (character-specific)
Crew, ship, inventory
Faction reputation is initialized at neutral (0) or biased based on character.
During Gameplay:
Decks evolve through rewards.
Player interacts with world nodes.
Crew may die, mutate, level up.
Faction rep adjusts in real-time:
Card draw % → passive reputation shift.
Quest decisions → active change.
Local RunState is updated per frame.
Periodic auto-sync with server for recovery/resume.
On Player Death or Run End:
Game ends → data summary generated.
RunState is finalized → archived or discarded.
PlayerProfile is updated:
XP gained
Cards/Characters unlocked
Meta abilities unlocked
New unlocks are pushed to player UI immediately.
4. Storage Model (Database)
MongoDB (NoSQL) Schema Recommendation:
yaml
Copy

Decks (in-run)	RAM	Volatile	Persisted via RunState
Inventory	RAM	Volatile	Linked to RunState
Galaxy Map	Procedurally generated	On demand	Based on seed
Meta Upgrades	Server DB	Persistent	Unlocked through XP
6. Additional Features
Cloud Sync: Each run state can be backed up every N seconds to Next.js backend (to enable resume on crash or across devices).
Offline Mode: Core gameplay (combat, cards, deck-building) works offline; syncs when reconnected.
AI Microservices:
Use OpenAI to generate dynamic encounters on backend.
Run stability image generation tasks for custom cards or backdrops (on demand).

Here’s the full Game Data Architecture & Flow Diagram showing how core entities flow through the client, server, and database layers:

Key Highlights:

Client (Phaser 3) manages active gameplay, deck logic, exploration, and encounter interactions.
RunState holds all the per-run data: decks, faction reputation, galaxy map, inventory, and crew.
The Server (Next.js) syncs state, stores long-term progression, and handles procedural content seeding.
The Database stores persistent profiles, unlocked cards, reputation stats, and past run history.
