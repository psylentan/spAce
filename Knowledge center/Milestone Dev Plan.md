Streamlined Development Milestone Plan
Project: Top-Down Space Shooter RPG with Meta Progression & AI

PHASE 0 â€“ FOUNDATION
Goal: Set up environment, project structure, and planning documents

Milestone 0.1: Project Setup
âœ… Clean up project and initialize fresh repository
âœ… Set up Git with develop branch
âœ… Configure .gitignore for project specifics
âœ… Create project with Phaser 3, TypeScript, Webpack/Vite
  - âœ… Set up package.json with dependencies
  - âœ… Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json)
  - âœ… Set up Webpack (webpack.config.js)
  - âœ… Create HTML template and game entry point

âœ… Set up scene folder structure
  - src/scenes/core created

âœ… Create BootScene, PreloadScene, StartScene
  - âœ… BootScene: Implemented with loading bar assets and physics setup
  - âœ… PreloadScene: Implemented with loading bar and asset loading
  - âœ… StartScene: Implemented with main menu and game start

ðŸŸ¡ Create Game Entity Class Map
