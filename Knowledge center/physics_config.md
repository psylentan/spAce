Define the collision and physics rules.

Contents:
Collision Groups: Define which types of objects can collide (e.g., PLAYER with ENEMY, BULLET with ENEMY).

Physics Body Types: What kind of physics bodies each entity should use (e.g., STATIC for obstacles, DYNAMIC for player and enemy ships).

Velocity and Acceleration Constants: Define default constants (e.g., max speed of ships, bullet velocity).

Collision Handling Rules: Rules for handling collisions (e.g., when Bullet hits Enemy, deal damage and destroy both).
