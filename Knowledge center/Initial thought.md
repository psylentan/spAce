### eventually gododt was replaced by Phaser

You can absolutely develop everything within Cursor.ai, leveraging GitHub, MCP integrations, and automated asset generation, without jumping between different tools. The key is to centralize your workflow in Cursor, using MCPs to communicate with Godot, Blender, Phaser, or even custom pipelines. Here’s how:

1. Using GitHub as Your Central Repository
Since you want everything in one place, GitHub will act as your project hub, where:

Your game code (Godot, Phaser, etc.) lives.
Your AI-generated assets (Blender models, textures, etc.) get stored.
Your game design documents and logic files are managed.
Setting Up Cursor.ai to Work with GitHub
Link Cursor.ai to Your GitHub Repository

In Cursor.ai, go to Settings > Integrations > GitHub and connect your account.
Clone your GitHub repository inside Cursor (git clone <repo-url>).
Work directly in Cursor, committing changes to GitHub.
Use Cursor to Write and Edit Code

Cursor.ai can write GDScript (for Godot) or JavaScript/TypeScript (for Phaser) in your GitHub repository.
No need to switch platforms – just ask Cursor to write, debug, or refactor code inside the repository.
2. Setting Up MCPs to Automate Asset Generation
You don’t need to manually switch to Blender, Photoshop, or other tools to generate assets. Instead, you can:

Automate asset generation using Blender MCP.
Generate sprites/UI automatically with a custom AI MCP server.
How to Set Up MCP Servers for Asset Generation
Blender MCP (for 3D Models & Animations)

Run a Blender Python MCP server that listens for commands from Cursor.
Example:
sh
Copy
Edit
python blender_mcp_server.py
Inside blender_mcp_server.py:
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request
import bpy

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate_model', methods=['POST'])
def generate_model():
    data = request.json
    obj_name = data.get('name', 'DefaultCube')
    
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()
    cube = bpy.context.object
    cube.name = obj_name

    return {'message': f'Model {obj_name} created successfully'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
Now, from Cursor.ai, you can send HTTP requests to this MCP, asking it to generate 3D models dynamically!
Image & Sprite Generation MCP

If you need 2D sprites (like UI buttons, textures, characters), set up an AI-based asset generator.
Example using Stable Diffusion API:
python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def generate_sprite(prompt):
    response = requests.post("https://stablediffusion.com/api/generate", json={"prompt": prompt})
    return response.json()["image_url"]
Now, you can ask Cursor.ai to "Generate a fantasy UI button" and it will auto-create the image, store it in GitHub, and link it inside Godot or Phaser.
3. Running & Testing the Game Directly from Cursor
Once you have your game logic and assets stored in GitHub, you can automate the build process.

For Godot
Set Up a Godot MCP Server

You can run Godot headless on a remote server:
sh
Copy
Edit
godot --headless --export "Windows Desktop" build/game.exe
Use an MCP server to compile & run the game remotely.
Automate Playtesting

Use AI-based testing to check for UI errors, physics issues, and mechanics bugs.
Example: Cursor.ai analyzes gameplay logs and suggests balance changes.
For Phaser (HTML5/Web)
Run Phaser Inside Cursor
Start a local server with:
sh
Copy
Edit
python -m http.server 8000
Open localhost:8000 inside Cursor to test Phaser games without leaving the platform.
4. Connecting Everything with Custom MCP Pipelines
By setting up custom MCPs, you can tell Cursor.ai to orchestrate the entire workflow. For example:

Game Design Phase

Ask Cursor to create a game scene in GDScript/TypeScript.
The AI writes and commits the script directly to GitHub.
Asset Generation

Ask Cursor to generate 3D models → Blender MCP auto-creates them.
Ask for UI buttons → AI sprite generator creates assets & uploads them.
Game Testing

Run the Godot MCP or Phaser MCP to execute the game remotely.
Cursor reads logs, detects errors, and suggests fixes.
Build & Deployment

Cursor triggers a GitHub Action to compile and deploy the game.
5. Summary – The Full Workflow in Cursor.ai
Game code & logic is stored in GitHub.
Cursor writes & edits game scripts directly.
MCP Servers (Godot, Blender, Image Gen) automate asset creation & game testing.
Cursor runs the game remotely without switching tools.
Cursor AI analyzes logs, finds bugs, and improves mechanics.
TL;DR – You Stay in Cursor, Everything Else is Automated
No switching tabs. Everything (code, assets, testing) is controlled from Cursor.ai.
GitHub is the hub. MCPs push & pull data between tools automatically.
You focus on vibing. AI generates code, assets, and even helps balance gameplay.
This setup turns Cursor.ai into a full game development hub – no need to jump between tools!
