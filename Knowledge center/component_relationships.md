This will explain how all the game components interact.

Contents:
Visual Diagrams: Illustrate how entities like PlayerShip, Enemy, PowerUp, and Effects relate.

Use arrows to show relationships (e.g., PlayerShip → EffectManager → Effect).

Data Flow Between Components: Document how data is passed (e.g., PlayerShip → EffectManager → Effect).

Parent-Child Relationships: Describe hierarchy, such as Ship having multiple CrewMembers or PlayerShip having one Weapon.

System Dependencies: Identify systems that rely on others, e.g., PhysicsSystem → CollisionSystem → DamageSystem.
