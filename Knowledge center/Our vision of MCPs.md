Model Context Protocols (MCPs) for Game Development
MCPs extend Cursor.ai by connecting the AI to external tools and data, which is especially useful in game development. Key MCPs include:
BrowserTools MCP – Lets the AI inspect a running web game’s interface or DOM in real-time. This is invaluable for UI testing and debugging; for example, the AI can observe the frontend’s state or DOM changes to verify UI mechanics​
FORUM.CURSOR.COM
. In a game context, you could run an HTML5 game or a UI in a browser and have Cursor’s AI read elements on screen to help diagnose layout issues or respond to user interactions.
FileSearch MCP – Enables the AI to search your codebase or assets by keywords. In large game projects, this is useful for quickly locating where a certain game mechanic is implemented or where an asset is referenced​
FORUM.CURSOR.COM
. The AI can pull in relevant code snippets (like a physics calculation or input handling code) from anywhere in your project to inform its suggestions, ensuring consistency across your game’s modules.
Web Search MCP – Allows the AI to fetch documentation or solutions from the internet on the fly. This is extremely helpful when working with game frameworks or libraries; for instance, the AI can look up a Godot or LibGDX API usage, or search Stack Overflow for an error message​
CURSOR101.COM
. By integrating a web search tool, Cursor can provide code fixes or optimizations backed by real documentation instead of guessing, which reduces hallucinations.
GitHub Integration MCP – Connects the AI to GitHub repositories. This can be used to pull open-source code examples (like a snippet of a character controller or shader code from an existing project) or to analyze diff/patch files for your game. For example, there are MCP servers that extract diffs from GitHub pull requests, letting the AI retrieve code changes for review​
GLAMA.AI
. In practice, you could have the AI review an open-source library’s code to see how a feature (e.g. pathfinding) is implemented and then adapt it to your game.
Filesystem/Terminal MCPs – These let the AI execute commands or read/write files on your system (with your approval). For game development, such tools can automate building the project or running tests. For instance, the AI could call a build script to compile your game for PC or mobile, then read the compiler output to help fix errors. It could also generate asset files (like JSON level data or shader files) directly into your project. By using a terminal MCP, the AI essentially becomes a co-scripter that can run engine CLI tools (e.g., Godot’s export command or Unity’s headless build) and then react to the results.
Leveraging MCPs effectively: Include and configure these MCPs in Cursor so the AI can use them when needed. For example, when debugging a gameplay bug that only appears on mobile, you might prompt the AI to use Web Search for that error on Android forums, or use FileSearch to scan your code for platform-specific logic. During UI development, let the AI use BrowserTools to verify that a button press in the web build triggers the correct event. By approving the AI’s tool usage at key moments, you ensure it has up-to-date context and can provide solutions grounded in actual data and live feedback from your game. This tight integration reduces guesswork and speeds up development significantly.
Open-Source Game Frameworks and Engines (Mechanics & UI)
Using an open-source, cross-platform engine means you can target PC and mobile with the same codebase, and Cursor’s AI can be guided to follow these frameworks’ best practices. Here are some popular libraries focused on game mechanics and UI:
Godot Engine – A free, MIT-licensed 2D and 3D engine known for its node-based architecture and built-in editor. Godot is fully cross-platform: you can author on Windows/Mac/Linux and export games to PC, mobile, web, and more​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. It has an integrated physics engine, a flexible scene system, and UI Control nodes for building in-game interfaces. This means you can design levels and UIs visually, then have the AI generate GDScript or C# code that ties it all together. Godot’s open API and thorough documentation make it easy to integrate with Cursor – for instance, you could enable a Web Search MCP to pull up Godot’s docs whenever the AI needs to use a specific node or function. The engine’s cross-platform nature ensures that mechanics (physics, input, etc.) and UI layouts you implement will work uniformly on PC and mobile. Cursor can help by writing platform-specific export configurations or suggesting tweaks (like using adaptive UI scaling) to make your game look good on both a desktop monitor and a phone screen.
LibGDX – An open-source Java framework that provides a unified API for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and HTML5 browsers​
LIBGDX.COM
. LibGDX is light-weight and code-centric, which pairs well with an AI coding assistant. It includes batteries-included features for game mechanics: 2D/3D rendering, a physics engine (Box2D integration), audio, and an extensive Scene2D UI toolkit for menus and HUDs. Notably, LibGDX’s Scene2D library offers a full widget system (buttons, layouts, etc.) and skinning support for UI​
LIBGDX.COM
. With Cursor, you can leverage these by having .cursorrules that tell the AI to prefer Scene2D for UI (ensuring it generates code using LibGDX’s Stage and Table classes for layout, for example). The AI, equipped with FileSearch, can quickly find where you loaded a texture or how you set up an InputProcessor, and then suggest new game mechanics code that fits in. Because LibGDX uses one codebase for all targets, the AI’s contributions (say, a new player movement system or UI screen) will run on both PC and mobile – it might even remind you to account for touch input versus mouse input, thanks to LibGDX’s input abstraction.
Cocos2d-x – A widely used open-source game engine in C++ (with bindings for JavaScript and Lua) aimed at 2D games. Cocos2d-x is optimized for mobile (it boasts compatibility with 99%+ of Android and iOS devices) but also supports Windows and macOS, allowing desktop builds​
COCOS2D-X.ORG
​
COCOS2D-X.ORG
. It provides a straightforward API for sprites, animations, physics, and UI elements. In Cursor, you could set rules for Cocos2d-x that encourage the AI to use its scene graph and actions (for animations) properly, rather than writing custom loops. Since Cocos2d-x has a bit less built-in UI tooling compared to Godot or LibGDX, you might use the AI to integrate third-party UI libraries or to generate boilerplate for menus (for example, creating a stack of buttons for a settings screen and handling touch events). The AI’s assistance can accelerate dealing with cross-platform quirks – e.g., it can insert compiler directives or adjust CMake files for Android vs. desktop when building your Cocos2d-x project.
Phaser (HTML5) – An open-source 2D game framework for HTML5, using JavaScript or TypeScript. Phaser is fast and fun, and it supports both Canvas and WebGL rendering across desktop and mobile browsers​
GITHUB.COM
. It’s excellent for web-deployed games or prototypes: you can run the same game in a browser on PC or on a mobile device. With Cursor’s BrowserTools MCP, the AI can even preview and interact with the running Phaser game. For example, as you develop a UI in Phaser (which uses HTML5 canvas elements), the AI could observe the game’s canvas via the browser and verify if a sprite moved correctly after a physics impulse. Phaser has built-in support for common game mechanics (tilemaps, tweening, simple physics like Arcade or more advanced physics engines like Matter.js). You can let the AI know via rules that you’re using Phaser, and it will produce idiomatic code (such as using Phaser’s scene lifecycle methods and proper asset preloading). Since Phaser games run in a browser, packaging for mobile involves using tools like Cordova or Capacitor – tasks that Cursor’s AI can assist with (e.g., generating a Cordova config file) once you enable it to search for the needed steps online.
MonoGame – An open-source .NET framework for game development, famous as the spiritual successor to Microsoft XNA. MonoGame allows C# developers to build games that run on Windows, Linux, macOS, as well as mobile platforms (Android, iOS) and even consoles​
GITHUB.COM
. It doesn’t come with an editor GUI – you write code in C# – which makes AI assistance particularly useful. Cursor can help write rendering code, handle content loading, and implement game logic using MonoGame’s framework (for instance, using the Content Pipeline for assets or suggesting the use of MonoGame.Extended library for additional features). With proper rules, you can have the AI follow XNA’s architecture, ensuring it organizes your game into the familiar Update/Draw loop structure and uses things like SpriteBatch correctly. Because MonoGame is low-level compared to engines like Godot, you might rely on the AI to draft systems like an entity-component system or a UI layout manager on top of MonoGame – effectively letting it generate higher-level patterns while you focus on tweaking the game design. MonoGame’s cross-platform reach (including mobile) is achieved by the framework handling the platform details, so the AI just needs to stick to the framework’s API and your game will work on all targets.
Leveraging these frameworks with Cursor: Whichever engine or library you choose, integrate its documentation and best practices into Cursor. For example, add a rule file that summarizes the engine’s key classes and coding style (if one isn’t already available in the community). Use the Web Search MCP for on-demand lookups – e.g., “search how to implement character swipe controls in Godot mobile”. The AI can then write code using the engine’s API, and even suggest engine-specific optimizations (like using an object pool for bullets in LibGDX to avoid garbage collection pauses​
LIBGDX.COM
). By having the AI handle boilerplate and recall platform nuances, you can iterate on game mechanics and UI faster. The AI might generate a draft of a UI menu, then you test it on both PC and a phone – if something looks off on the phone, ask Cursor to fix the layout, possibly with the BrowserTools MCP inspecting the mobile view. This tight loop, with the AI’s knowledge augmented by MCPs, helps ensure your game’s mechanics and interface work smoothly across devices.
Open-Source Tools for Graphical Assets
High-quality visual assets are crucial for game mechanics (think character sprites or 3D models) and UI (icons, menus). Fortunately, there are open-source tools for asset creation that integrate well into a Cursor-assisted workflow:
Blender – A powerful free, open-source 3D creation suite​
PORTABLEAPPS.COM
. Blender is used for modeling characters, creating 3D environments, rigging and animating models, and even sculpting high-detail assets. In a Cursor workflow, you can use Blender to make your 3D models, then have the AI assist in exporting or optimizing them for your game engine. For example, the AI could generate a Blender Python script to automatically apply transformations and export all your models to glTF format ready for Godot. If you encounter issues like high polygon count or improper normals, the AI (with web search) can suggest solutions (perhaps it finds a known Blender add-on or script to decimate models for mobile without losing much quality). By including notes in your .cursorrules about asset constraints (e.g. “models should be under 5k polygons for mobile”), the AI can even remind you during development to keep assets lightweight. Blender’s cross-platform availability means your artists can work on any OS, and the output will integrate the same way into your PC or mobile build of the game.
Krita & GIMP – These are free open-source painting and image editing programs. Krita is geared towards digital painting and 2D art creation​
KRITA.ORG
, while GIMP is a general image manipulation tool. They are ideal for creating textures, concept art, UI graphics, and sprites. You can draw your game’s graphics in Krita (for example, a set of fantasy UI icons or a 2D sprite sheet) and then let Cursor’s AI help incorporate them into the game. The AI might write a snippet to load these assets (like a sprite atlas in Phaser or a Texture in LibGDX) and even help generate normal maps or font files if needed. With an MCP that can call command-line tools, the AI could invoke image optimization utilities (like compressing PNGs) to prepare assets for mobile. Moreover, if you maintain an asset list, the AI can ensure every required asset is accounted for in the loading screen by cross-referencing it via FileSearch. Essentially, open-source art tools cover the creation side, and Cursor covers the integration side – bridging them, you might ask the AI to “generate a NinePatch image from this button PNG for Android” and it can guide you through using GIMP or do part of it if scripted.
Asset Management Libraries – Incorporating assets into games often involves specialized libraries, many of which are open source. For instance, Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) can load dozens of 3D model formats; FreeType is an open-source font rendering engine (used in many frameworks to render text in UI); and SDL_image or STB Image handle loading image files. While you might not use these directly if you have a high-level engine, it’s good to know they exist. Cursor’s AI can leverage knowledge of these libraries when needed – e.g., if your game uses a custom C++ engine, the AI could suggest using Assimp to load models instead of writing a parser from scratch. Because these libraries are cross-platform, the AI’s suggestion will work on both PC and mobile (with proper compilation). Ensure your .cursorrules or prompts clarify which libraries are in play (e.g., “we use FreeType for text rendering”), so the AI writes compatible code.
Effective asset pipeline with Cursor: Keep your asset creation and game integration loop tight. For example, after creating a new UI layout in Blender (say you designed a 3D HUD element), you can ask Cursor to incorporate it: the AI might use the engine’s API to place that asset in the scene and even propose shader code to make it blend with the environment. If you are unsure how to optimize an asset for mobile, ask the AI (it could respond with tips like reducing texture resolution or using compressed formats, possibly citing mobile GPU guidelines). By using open-source tools, you and the AI can also read their source code or scripts – for instance, the AI via FileSearch MCP could read a Blender export script to troubleshoot why a certain material isn’t coming through in Godot. This transparency and the ability to script/automate tasks mean you can iterate on assets rapidly, with the AI handling repetitive conversions or adjustments. In summary, open-source asset tools give you freedom and control over your game’s visuals, and when paired with Cursor’s AI, they become part of an intelligent pipeline that prepares and integrates those assets into your game across all platforms.
Custom Cursor Rules for Game Development
Cursor’s .cursorrules files let you shape the AI’s behavior to suit game development needs. By writing rules that encapsulate your game’s design principles and the best practices of your chosen engine, you ensure the AI’s contributions are on-point. Here’s how to leverage Cursor rules in a game dev context:
Enforce Game Architecture & Best Practices: Use rules to teach the AI about the game engine’s architecture and your coding standards. For example, a community-provided Unity C# rule file instructs the AI to “use Unity’s component-based architecture” and to utilize Unity’s built-in systems (physics, Input, UI) rather than reinventing them​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
. This means when you ask the AI to add a gameplay feature, the response will likely create a new MonoBehaviour or use a Unity physics collider as appropriate, aligning with how a skilled Unity developer would do it. Similarly, if you’re using Godot, you might write rules about using Signals for decoupled events, or using Godot’s AnimationPlayer for cutscenes. The AI will then follow these hints – for instance, if you request a “health pickup” feature, it would know (from your rules) to perhaps make it a Node with an Area2D (Godot’s 2D trigger zone) and emit a signal on pickup, rather than some non-idiomatic approach.
Cross-Platform and Performance Considerations: Game rules can remind the AI of platform differences and performance goals. You can add rules like “if writing input code, handle both mouse/keyboard and touch controls” or “prefer optimized techniques for mobile (e.g., object pooling over frequent allocation)”. The Unity rules example actually includes guidance to use the Unity Input System for handling player input on multiple platforms​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
, and to use the engine’s profiler for performance tuning. By codifying such advice, whenever Cursor generates code, it will, for example, automatically include touch input handlers alongside keyboard controls, or use an engine’s batching API to optimize rendering. This leads to game mechanics that are ready for PC (high-performance) and mobile (constrained environment) without extensive rewrites. If the AI suggests something costly, your rules (acting like a watchful senior developer) can nudge it towards a more efficient alternative.
Consistency in Coding Style and Usage of Libraries: Maintaining consistent code is key in larger game projects, and rules help achieve that. You can specify naming conventions (for example, “name UI nodes with ui_ prefix”) and the AI will adhere to them, reducing cleanup work. More powerfully, you can embed knowledge of your game’s existing code and libraries. If you have a custom module (say a GameMath library for common calculations or a particular UI framework), list it in the rules and describe how to use it. The AI will then prefer calling your utility functions instead of standard ones. As an illustration, if you created a helper function for pathfinding, a rule can instruct “when needing AI pathfinding, use GameMath.FindPath() instead of writing a new A*,” ensuring the AI doesn’t duplicate code. This context-awareness is a known benefit: by providing project-specific details (architecture decisions, key methods, etc.) in the rules, you get more informed code generation​
GITHUB.COM
. The AI effectively remembers the “design manual” of your game each time it writes code.
Examples of Game-Focused Rules: To get started, you can use or adapt existing rule sets from the community (there’s a curated list of .cursorrules for various technologies). For instance, the Unity rules file we mentioned not only covers architecture but also specifics like using Coroutines for time-based events and leveraging Unity’s prefab system for reusability​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
. If you were using a library like Phaser, you might include rules such as “always preload assets in the preload() function before using them” and “organize game logic into Phaser scenes.” For Godot GDScript, rules could enforce its naming style and suggest using the _process vs _physics_process functions appropriately. The key is to encode both mechanics (e.g., “use the engine’s physics API for collisions”) and UI guidelines (e.g., “for UI, use engine’s native UI nodes/widgets rather than custom draw calls”) into the rules. That way, whether the AI is writing gameplay code or crafting a new UI panel, it follows suit.
Improving AI Output and Reducing Errors: With well-crafted rules, the AI is less likely to make mistakes or go against the grain of your framework. It won’t suggest an HTML canvas approach if your rule says you’re using Godot for UI, for example. Moreover, rules can mitigate common errors – you can add a rule like “in Unity, never use GameObject.Find in Update loops (for performance)” or “in LibGDX, avoid creating new objects inside the render loop”. The AI will heed these, citing your rule rationale in its explanation if needed. This leads to cleaner, more optimized code generation by default, saving you from having to refactor later. As a bonus, a shared rules file keeps a team on the same page: if multiple developers (and thus multiple Cursor instances) are working on the game, the rules ensure the AI gives consistent guidance to everyone​
GITHUB.COM
, which is especially useful in collaborative game development.
Leveraging rules effectively: Start by writing a .cursorrules that covers the points above for your project. Think of it as writing documentation for an ideal junior developer – which in this case is the AI. Include sections on how to handle input, how to structure game objects, how to manage UI, and any engine-specific tips. You can even specify preferred open-source libraries (“use OpenGL ES 3.0 via LibGDX’s API if possible”) and the AI will follow suit. If you’re not sure what to put, you can find examples like “Unity (C#) Game Development” rules which demonstrate many best practices (e.g., using Unity’s physics and tag system for game interactions)​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
​
CURSOR.DIRECTORY
. Tailor those to your needs. Once rules are in place, you’ll notice the AI’s code suggestions become more aligned with how you envision the game. It will produce not just any working code, but code that fits your style, uses the right patterns for mechanics, and integrates assets in the expected way. In essence, MCPs give Cursor the ability to fetch information and act, open-source libraries provide the building blocks for your game, and your custom Cursor rules tie it all together by guiding the AI’s hand. With these tools combined, you have a development environment where the AI can meaningfully assist in creating a game’s mechanics, UI, and graphics pipeline for both PC and mobile – all while staying within the lines you’ve drawn for it, leading to a faster and more efficient game development process.​

How to create a phaser html5 MCP server?
ChatGPT said:
Creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Phaser (HTML5) in Cursor.ai involves setting up a local or cloud-based service that can interact with your Phaser game, providing data and responding to AI queries dynamically. The goal is to allow the AI assistant to read game state, send commands, and assist with debugging or content generation.

Step 1: Define the MCP Server’s Purpose
Your Phaser MCP server will:

Expose game data (e.g., player position, game state, score, active sprites).
Receive AI commands (e.g., spawn entities, change level properties, modify UI).
Provide debugging insights (e.g., log errors, performance stats, UI interactions).
Step 2: Set Up a Basic Node.js Server
Since Phaser is built with JavaScript, we’ll use Node.js with Express to create an MCP server that communicates via WebSockets or HTTP API.

1. Install Node.js & Express
Make sure you have Node.js installed, then create a new MCP project:

sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir phaser-mcp-server && cd phaser-mcp-server
npm init -y
npm install express ws cors
express: For handling API requests.
ws: WebSockets support (real-time communication with Phaser).
cors: Allows cross-origin requests from the Phaser game.
Step 3: Implement the MCP Server
Create a file called server.js:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

let gameState = {
    player: { x: 100, y: 200, health: 100 },
    enemies: [],
    score: 0
};

// REST API to fetch game state
app.get('/mcp/game-state', (req, res) => {
    res.json(gameState);
});

// REST API to modify game state
app.post('/mcp/set-player', (req, res) => {
    const { x, y, health } = req.body;
    gameState.player = { x, y, health };
    res.json({ success: true, player: gameState.player });
});

// WebSocket handling
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
    console.log('MCP WebSocket Connected');

    ws.on('message', (message) => {
        try {
            const command = JSON.parse(message);
            if (command.type === 'spawn-enemy') {
                gameState.enemies.push({ x: command.x, y: command.y, type: command.enemyType });
                ws.send(JSON.stringify({ success: true, message: 'Enemy spawned' }));
            } else if (command.type === 'update-score') {
                gameState.score += command.value;
                ws.send(JSON.stringify({ success: true, score: gameState.score }));
            }
        } catch (error) {
            ws.send(JSON.stringify({ success: false, error: 'Invalid command' }));
        }
    });

    ws.on('close', () => console.log('MCP WebSocket Disconnected'));
});

server.listen(3001, () => console.log('MCP Server running on port 3001'));
This sets up:

HTTP API (/mcp/game-state, /mcp/set-player) to read/update game state.
WebSocket server to handle real-time interactions.
Step 4: Connect Phaser to the MCP Server
Modify your Phaser game to communicate with the MCP server.

1. Load MCP Data into Phaser
Inside your Phaser game’s scene file:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch('http://localhost:3001/mcp/game-state')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log('Loaded game state:', data);
        // Example: Update player’s position based on MCP data
        player.setPosition(data.player.x, data.player.y);
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Failed to load MCP data:', error));
2. Send Data from Phaser to MCP
For example, when the player collects a coin:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function updateScore(value) {
    fetch('http://localhost:3001/mcp/set-score', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ value })
    });
}
3. Use WebSockets for Real-Time Updates
javascript
Copy
Edit
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3001');

ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected to MCP WebSocket');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('MCP Update:', data);
};

// Send a command to spawn an enemy
function spawnEnemy(x, y, type) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'spawn-enemy', x, y, enemyType: type }));
}
Step 5: Integrate MCP with Cursor.ai
Now, let’s make Cursor.ai aware of the MCP.

Enable MCP Integration in Cursor

Open Cursor.ai Settings and navigate to MCP Configuration.
Add a New MCP Endpoint:
Name: Phaser MCP
Type: HTTP & WebSocket
API URL: http://localhost:3001/mcp/game-state
WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:3001
Methods: GET, POST, WS
Define Cursor Rules for MCP Create a .cursorrules file in your Phaser project:

perl
Copy
Edit
# MCP Rules for Phaser Game
- When AI needs game data, use the MCP server (http://localhost:3001/mcp/game-state).
- Use WebSocket commands for real-time updates (ws://localhost:3001).
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation; use Phaser API instead.
- For UI changes, call Phaser scene methods, not direct element modifications.
This ensures Cursor follows proper Phaser best practices.

Step 6: Deploy the MCP Server
Once working locally, you can deploy the MCP server to a cloud service:

Vercel (for REST APIs only)
Railway.app (Node.js hosting)
Render.com (free WebSocket hosting)
AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean (self-hosting)
Step 7: Test & Expand
Now you can: ✅ Ask Cursor to fetch real-time game state.
✅ Send commands to change game logic dynamically.
✅ Debug UI and mechanics using MCP insights.

Next Steps
Add more endpoints (e.g., level management, UI updates).
Allow AI-generated game events (e.g., AI spawns obstacles dynamically).
Use Cursor MCP actions for automated debugging & balancing.
This setup creates an interactive MCP server for Phaser HTML5, allowing Cursor AI to assist in real-time with game mechanics, UI, and debugging! Let me know if you need more features added!
