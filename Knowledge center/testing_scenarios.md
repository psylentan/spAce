Document the test cases and scenarios.

Contents:
Unit Test Cases: Define unit tests for each major system (e.g., PlayerShip moves correctly).

Integration Test Flows: Tests for how entities interact (e.g., Bullet hits Enemy and applies damage).

Edge Cases: Scenarios like extreme values or unexpected inputs.

Performance Test Scenarios: Test the game under heavy load (e.g., many enemies, large explosions).
