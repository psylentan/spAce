Document all sprite animations and transitions.

Contents:
Sprite Animations for Each Entity: Define which sprites get which animations (e.g., PlayerShip has idle, moving, and shooting animations).

Animation Triggers: What triggers each animation (e.g., PlayerShip starts shooting animation when firing).

Frame Sequences: What frames each animation cycle includes.

Transition Conditions: Conditions for changing animation states (e.g., transition from moving to idle if the player stops).
