# World Generation System

## Overview
Procedural generation system for creating the game world, including sectors, planets, stations, and encounters.

## Key Questions
1. World Structure
   - How is the galaxy map organized?
   - What determines sector layout?
   - How are points of interest distributed?

2. Content Generation
   - What content needs to be procedural vs hand-crafted?
   - How are encounters generated?
   - How is difficulty scaled across regions?

3. Persistence
   - What world elements persist between runs?
   - How are seeds handled?
   - How is player progress tracked across the world?

## Technical Specifications

### World Structure
```typescript
interface GalaxyMap {
  id: string;
  seed: string;
  sectors: Sector[];
  factionControl: Record<string, string[]>; // factionId -> sectorIds
  anomalies: Anomaly[];
  version: number;
}

interface Sector {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: SectorType;
  controllingFaction?: string;
  stability: number;
  points: PointOfInterest[];
  connections: string[]; // sectorIds
}

interface PointOfInterest {
  id: string;
  type: 'planet' | 'station' | 'anomaly' | 'event';
  position: Vector2;
  content: any; // Specific content type
  discovered: boolean;
  visited: boolean;
}
```

### Generation System
```typescript
interface WorldGenerator {
  generateGalaxy(seed: string): GalaxyMap;
  generateSector(params: SectorParams): Sector;
  generatePlanet(params: PlanetParams): Planet;
  generateStation(params: StationParams): Station;
  generateEncounter(type: EncounterType, difficulty: number): Encounter;
}
```

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Implement basic galaxy structure
- [ ] Create sector generation
- [ ] Build point of interest system

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Add encounter generation
- [ ] Implement difficulty scaling
- [ ] Create content variation system

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Add special events
- [ ] Implement story integration
- [ ] Create dynamic world changes

## Dependencies
- Faction system
- Combat system
- Quest system
- Save system

## Open Questions
1. How much of the map should be visible initially?
2. How should secret areas be handled?
3. Should sectors have special modifiers?
4. How will the anomaly affect world generation?
5. How should random events be distributed?

## Generation Types
