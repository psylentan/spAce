# Faction System

## Overview
Dynamic faction system that manages relationships, territories, and influences gameplay through reputation and alignment.

## Key Questions
1. Faction Structure
   - How many factions should exist in the base game?
   - What defines a faction's identity?
   - How do factions interact with each other?

2. Reputation System
   - How is reputation calculated?
   - What are the thresholds for different reputation levels?
   - How quickly should reputation change?

3. Territory Control
   - How do factions control territory?
   - What determines territory changes?
   - How do contested spaces work?

## Technical Specifications

### Faction Interface
```typescript
interface Faction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  traits: FactionTrait[];
  relationships: Record<string, FactionRelationship>;
  territory: Territory[];
  resources: Record<string, number>;
  technology: TechnologyTree;
}

interface FactionRelationship {
  status: 'allied' | 'friendly' | 'neutral' | 'hostile' | 'war';
  score: number; // -100 to 100
  treaties: Treaty[];
  lastInteraction: Date;
}
```

### Reputation System
```typescript
interface PlayerFactionStatus {
  factionId: string;
  reputation: number;
  level: ReputationLevel;
  activeEffects: StatusEffect[];
  questsCompleted: number;
  questsFailed: number;
}

type ReputationLevel = 'revered' | 'allied' | 'friendly' | 'neutral' | 'suspicious' | 'hostile' | 'nemesis';
```
