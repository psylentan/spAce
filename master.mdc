# **Phaser-Based Space Exploration & Deck-Building Game**

## **📌 Project Overview**
We are developing a **space exploration and combat-focused deck-building game** using **Phaser 3**. This project is highly **experimental**, where we explore different "blocks" of mechanics, systems, and integrations to determine the best approach. The goal is to create a **modular**, **scalable**, and **AI-assisted** game development pipeline while keeping everything centralized within **Cursor.ai** and GitHub.
