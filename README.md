# Space Game

A simple space game built with Phaser 3.

## Controls

The ship can be controlled using either mouse + keyboard or keyboard only:

### Mouse + Keyboard (Default)
- **Mouse Movement**: Aim the ship (ship will rotate to follow mouse)
- `‚Üë` (Up Arrow): Thrust forward in the direction the ship is facing
- `‚Üì` (Down Arrow): Brake (reduces current velocity)
- `Space`: Toggle between mouse/keyboard control modes

### Keyboard Only Mode
- `‚Üê` (Left Arrow): Rotate ship counter-clockwise
- `‚Üí` (Right Arrow): Rotate ship clockwise
- `‚Üë` (Up Arrow): Thrust forward in the direction the ship is facing
- `‚Üì` (Down Arrow): Brake (reduces current velocity)
- `Space`: Toggle between mouse/keyboard control modes

## Movement System

The movement system uses Phaser's arcade physics with the following characteristics:

- Zero gravity environment (space-like)
- Configurable ship properties via ShipConfig
- Real-time debug display showing speed and position
- Proper acceleration and max speed implementation

Current ship configuration:
- Max Speed: 700 pixels/sec
- Acceleration: 30 units/sec¬≤
- Rotation Speed: 150-250 degrees/sec
- Brake Force: 20% velocity reduction per frame
- Mouse Rotation: Dynamic smooth tracking
